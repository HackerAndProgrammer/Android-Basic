In this directory you will find all the projects that I developed and all the concepts that I learned in my most basic beginning stage in Android. 
In this repository no type of structure is followed, there are no good practices, no testing, no absolutely anything other than the pure basics. 
You will find the basics of Kotlin, and small apps that demonstrate many concepts learned throughout my career in Android Basic: 

---

-Recycler Views



-viewBindings



-graphic components (RadioGroups, Editexts, SearchViews, Checkbox, Switches, RangeSliders, TextViews, Views, Buttons, CardViews, etc), Constraint layouts, Linear layouts, Frame layouts, etc. 



-Small apps that are advancing in their level of complexity, one more complex than the other 



-Access and consumption of API services with Retrofit



-bug management



-data persistence with dataStore



-value storage



-and much more.

It is important to clarify that the apps developed in this repository are NOT the same as in the Arisguimera course, since these apps are developed by me and I personalized them, commented on them, added functionalities, improved and updated them, to put the concepts learned into practice.
